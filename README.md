# Task-Manager-
#This is my attempt to build a personal task manager and practice my python. I am self taught so this will be done at a snails pace lol 
#I will be using a mixture of youtube toutorials, gemini, cursor and anything else I can get my hands on to figure it out. I do not know all of the concepts one would find and or use in #python so this is a trial and error kind of thing.
